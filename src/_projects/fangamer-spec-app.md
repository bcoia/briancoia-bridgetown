I made Fangamer's internal app that helps manage its product specs and launch planning. Over time, it has also evolved into a forum, calendar, wiki, and other internal tools. It replaced [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/).

Built in [Rails 7](https://rubyonrails.org/), slowly migrating to the [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) front-end stack. Features are developed in collaboration with other departments, design is mostly done off-the-cuff based on other UIs that inspired me.
