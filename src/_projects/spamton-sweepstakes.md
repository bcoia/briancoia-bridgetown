Charity event for DELTARUNE, celebrating UNDERTALE's 7th anniversary. Raised over $350,000 for Child's Play and Pakistan flood relief charities.

Built over the course of a month in a team of myself, another developer, and a designer. Uses the CloudFlare Workers serverless stack. Updates were fetched from Tiltify and eBay, cached, and served via WebSocket (or polling, if WebSockets were unavailable).
