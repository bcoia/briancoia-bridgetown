I helped create a supplemental site for [The Book of Bill](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-book-of-bill-alex-hirsch/1144490969), a Gravity Falls extended universe book.

The site features hundreds of scraps of bonus content for the book, across dozens of clickables and hundreds of codes. [Dozens of artists](https://x.com/_AlexHirsch/status/1823209449244553348) worked on the content. It saw millions of hits within the first few days of release.

The site is intended to feel Flash-like, but is mostly videos and images layered into a fixed frame. Content is loaded asynchronously (and serverless-ly), such that codes must be discovered before content is served.
