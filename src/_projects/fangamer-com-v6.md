Storefront for Fangamer merchandise. Home of hundreds of collections for dozens of games and partners.

Designed by [Fully Illustrated](https://fullyillustrated.com). I handled the implementation, this time rewriting most of the store into a modern-ish stack, rooted in Rails-adjacent tech (Hotwire, mostly).
