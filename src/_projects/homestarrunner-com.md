Before Flash died, I was contracted to create modern versions of Homestar Runner's homepage, toons page, and Strong Bad emails page.

The pages and all assets were designed by the Homestar Runner guys. I made them feel Flash-like, but usable by modern browsers, including phones. Other non-updated pages are served via [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/), the Flash emulator.

The site runs in [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/), a flat-file customizable CMS designed for odd sites like this.
