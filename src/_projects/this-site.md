This site was written in [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/), a new (as of time of writing) fork of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with some modern Ruby niceties.

Deploys automatically to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Fully static. Utilizes the [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) stack, to practice my Rails 7 front-end skills.
