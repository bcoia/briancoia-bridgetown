## Hi, I'm Brian!

I'm currently working at a [Fangamer](http://www.fangamer.com) as a Web Developer. I work on the Shopify front-end and various internal tools and applications, largely developed in Ruby on Rails and modern JavaScript.

I graduated with a Computer Science degree from University of Wisconsin-Parkside in 2014 (with a minor in Web Development), then dove headfirst into a career as a web developer.

I used to run [TrackMania servers](https://redco.in/tm) for popular gaming site [Giant Bomb](http://giantbomb.com). I play dumb games psuedo-competitively; for example, I am the [Fun and Games Champion of Ultimate Fighting Game Tournament 10](https://twitter.com/redcoin/status/576183007997886464). I occasionally stream on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/redcoin).
